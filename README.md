# ARL RISC-V Student Research

This repository contains folders from three different open-source RISC-V cores.

#### PicoRV32: https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32
#### SERV: https://github.com/olofk/serv
#### VexRiscv: https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv

All of these repositories have been modified for ease of use, and the Vex and Pico both now contain example GPIO code. Each folders README details their respective changes.
